## Wordle Meets Pok√©mon  
**Created by Parallax**

### About  
Guessemon is a fan-made game where Wordle meets Pok√©mon! It challenges players to guess the name of a randomly selected Pok√©mon. The game is built using **SvelteKit / Svelte 5** and integrates data from the [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/). On page load, a random Pok√©mon is fetched, and its name is set as the answer to the word puzzle. To assist players, the game provides hints in the form of the Pok√©mon's element type(s).

### Pok√©mon Name Filtering  
To keep the game fair, consistent, and interesting Pok√©mon names are filtered based on the following criteria:  
- **Name length**: Only Pok√©mon with names between 5 and 10 characters are included.  
- **No special characters**: Pok√©mon names containing dashes, spaces, or other non-alphabetical characters (e.g., `Ho-oh`, `Porygon-Z`) are excluded.  

### Leagues (Game Modes)
Guessemon offers three leagues to play based on your knowledge of the Pokemon Generations.
#### **1. Retro League**
- Pok√©mon are selected exclusively from **Generations 1 and 2**.
- Perfect for players who love the classic era of Pok√©mon.
- Fewer Pok√©mon to choose from, making it easier for nostalgic fans to guess.

#### **2. Common League**
